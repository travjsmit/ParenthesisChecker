Balanced Parentheses Checker using Stack in C#
Overview
The ParenthesisChecker class provides a method IsBalanced to determine if parentheses in a given string expression are balanced. The method uses a stack, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, making it well-suited for checking nested and ordered structures like parentheses.

Implementation Details
The core of this implementation is the use of a stack to track opening parentheses and ensure that each has a corresponding closing parenthesis. Here's how it works:

Push Opening Parentheses: Iterate through each character in the expression. For each opening parenthesis (, {, or [, push it onto the stack.

Match Closing Parentheses: For each closing parenthesis ), }, or ], check if it matches the top of the stack:

If the stack is empty or the top doesn't match, the expression is unbalanced.
Otherwise, pop the stack.
Check Stack State: At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

The IsBalanced method handles edge cases such as an empty string or strings without parentheses effectively.

Challenges and Solutions
During implementation, several challenges were encountered:

Namespace and Reference Issues: One of the primary issues was ensuring the unit test project could recognize the ParenthesisChecker class. This was resolved by:

Adding Project References: Ensuring that the test project had a reference to the main project containing the ParenthesisChecker.
Correct Namespace Usage: Including the correct namespace in the test files to access the ParenthesisChecker class.
Handling Nested Parentheses: Ensuring that nested structures were correctly matched required careful handling of stack operations to verify pairs. The IsMatchingPair helper method was crucial for checking if an opening parenthesis matched its corresponding closing one.

Efficiency Considerations: The implementation achieves optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the expression, since each character is processed once.

Unit Testing
A comprehensive set of unit tests was implemented to verify the correctness of the IsBalanced method:

Single-Type Balanced: Tests with expressions containing only one type of parenthesis, such as "()", "{}", and "[]".
Single-Type Unbalanced: Tests with unbalanced expressions, such as "(", "}", and "[".
Mixed-Type Balanced: Tests with correctly nested and ordered mixed types, like "{[()]}" and "[{()}]".
Mixed-Type Unbalanced: Tests with improperly nested or unmatched parentheses, such as "{[(])}" and "{[}".
Empty String: A test to ensure that an empty string is considered balanced.
These tests were implemented using MSTest in C# to ensure robust verification of the ParenthesisChecker.

Conclusion
The stack-based approach efficiently solves the problem of checking balanced parentheses, leveraging the stack's LIFO nature to manage nested and ordered pairs effectively. Through careful attention to implementation details and project setup, the solution is both correct and efficient, providing a practical example of stack usage in parsing expressions.
